This is a simple to-do list web application built with JavaScript, utilizing the MDL library for its front-end components. 

The app features three tabs: **Add Item**, **To-Do Tasks**, and **Completed**. 

- **Add Item**: Users can add a task to their list of To-Do Tasks. 
- **To-Do Tasks**: This tab displays the user's current list of to-do tasks. Users have the option to mark a task as completed, which moves it to the Completed tab, or they can delete it from the list entirely.
- **Completed**: This tab lists the tasks that the user has completed, with the option to delete them from the list.
